Triptan Therapy
-
It is quite selective (vascular) and abortive therapy for migraine (acute attack).
-
Triptans could be taken at any time during a migraine headache, but taking it ASAP is
best; i.e., the closest to headache, the better.
-
Triptans are selective 5HT-1b,d,f receptor agonists.
-
Triptans work also for cluster headaches.
-
The 7 Canadian triptans are:
X Almotriptan, Axert 12.5 mg tablets
X Eletriptan, Relpax40 mg tablets
Frovatriptan, Frova 2.5 mg tablets
X Naratriptan, Amerge 2.5 mg tablets
Rizatriptan, Maxalt 10 mg tablet and RPD 10 mg orally dissolving tablet
X Sumatriptan, Imitrex 50 mg and 100 mg tablets; injection 6 mg injection; nasal spray 20
mg nasal spray
Z Zolmitriptan, Zomig 2.5 mg tablet; rapimelt 2.5 mg orally dissolving tablet; 5 mg nasal
spray
-
Onset of Action:
o Fastest onset (5 min) = SC sumatriptan
o Nasal spray sumatriptan & zolmitriptan kicks in in 15 min (1sp/1nostril; NO priming;
NO shaking).
o ALL other forms, including wafers, kick in in 20-30 min, as they are ORAL dosage
forms & NOT buccally absorbed.
-
Orally disintegrating forms provide a “plus” for migraineurs with N/V or difficulty
swallowing pills.
-
Recurrence of migraine headaches is common after they are relieved by triptans.
-
NEVER repeat a triptan for the same original headache; i.e., if NOT relieved, AT LEAST
partially, use another medication; e.g., NSAID (NOT DHE)
-
May repeat triptan in 2 h for recurring symptoms/new headache (NOT pain of 1st attack)
-
Do NOT use 2 different triptans in the same 24-h period
-
For sumatriptan injection: If the migraine headache returns, or if a patient has a partial
response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 1 hour, and NOT more than
12 mg [2 injections] should be taken in any 24-h period.
-
For other oral dosage forms, the dose may only be repeated for recurring or partially
relieved headaches after 2 hours from the first oral dose.
-
Triptans should be avoided within 2 weeks of the use of a MAO inhibitor (selective
MAO-A I: moclobemide; non-selective MAO Is: phenelzine and tranylcypromine; MAO-B
Is rasagiline, and selegiline) which may decrease the metabolism of serotonin 5-HT1D
receptor agonists.
-
Caution with triptans and sulfa allergy EXCEPT rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, and frovatriptan
(NO sulfa group).
-
Caution with SS (SSRIs, TCAs, Li, etc.)
-
Caution with triptan overuse headache (see below)
